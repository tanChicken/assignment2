            Malaysia's tourist arrivals, peaking between 2016 and 2019, with
            totals exceeding 25 millions tourists annually. However, the
            <b>COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021</b> led to a dramatic decline
            in tourist arrivals and receipts. <br /><br />Despite the
            challenges, Malaysia implemented various recovery measures to
            revitalize its tourism industry, including vaccination campaigns.
            Following the
            <b>relaxation of global travel restrictions in 2022</b>, Malaysia
            witnessed a significant rebound in tourism, and the positive trend

          saw a dip in 2021 due to the pandemic. Many retail outlets, malls, and
          tourist shopping destinations were either closed or operating with
          restrictions, reducing tourist spending on shopping.

          <h2>Hotel Guests By States</h2>
          <p>
            In 2023, <b>Kuala Lumpur</b>, the capital city of Malaysia, leads
            with 18.4 million arrivals due to its status as a business and
            tourist center, drawing visitors for its iconic landmarks, shopping
            and international events.<br /><br /><b>Pulau Pinang</b> with over
            7.2 million in 2023 arrivals is also a major tourism hub due to its
            cultural heritage, beaches and UNESCO-listed George Town. This makes
            it a popular destination despite having a smaller area compared to
            other states.<br /><br /><b>Pahang</b> as a notable number of hotel
            guest arrivals despites its lower arrival per KM2 due to its vast
            land area. The lower density of arrivals per KM2 doesn't imply a
            lack of tourism but rather that the arrivals are spread across its
            extensive area. Pahang's appeal lies in its famous attractions like
            Cameron Highlands, Taman Negara, and Genting Highlands.

          <h2>Mode Of Transport</h2>
          <p>
            In 2023, land transportation was the dominant mode, accounting for
            55.8% of arrivals, with over 11 million tourists using this method.
            This reflects the convenience and accessibility of land routes,
            especially for regional travelers. Air travel followed with 36.7% of
            arrivals, highlighting the importance of international and
            long-distance travel for tourism, with over 7.3 million tourists
            arriving by air. <br /><br />Meanwhile, sea travel contributed 5.6%,
            likely linked to coastal destinations or cruise tourism. Rail travel
            had the smallest share at 1.9%, indicating limited infrastructure or
            less preference for rail journeys among tourists. The contrast
            between these modes shows the diverse ways tourists access
            destinations, with a
            <b>strong preference for road and air travel</b> over other forms of
            transport.
